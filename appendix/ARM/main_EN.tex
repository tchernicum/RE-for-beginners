\subsection{Terminology}

ARM was initially developed as 32-bit \ac{CPU}, 
so that's why a \emph{word} here, unlike x86, is 32-bit.

\begin{description}
	\item[byte] 8-bit.
		The DB assembly directive is used for defining variables and arrays of bytes.
	\item[halfword] 16-bit. DCW assembly directive \dittoclosing.
	\item[word] 32-bit.  DCD assembly directive \dittoclosing.
	\item[doubleword] 64-bit.
	\item[quadword] 128-bit.
\end{description}

\subsection{Versions}

\begin{itemize}
\item ARMv4: Thumb mode introduced.

\item ARMv6: used in iPhone 1st gen., iPhone 3G (Samsung 32-bit RISC ARM 1176JZ(F)-S that supports Thumb-2)

\item ARMv7: Thumb-2 was added (2003).
was used in iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPad 1st gen. (ARM Cortex-A8), iPad 2 (Cortex-A9),
iPad 3rd gen.

\item ARMv7s: New instructions added.
iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, iPad 4th gen. (Apple A6).

\item ARMv8: 64-bit CPU, \ac{AKA} ARM64 \ac{AKA} AArch64.
Was used in iPhone 5S, iPad Air (Apple A7).
There is no Thumb mode in 64-bit mode, only ARM (4-byte instructions).
