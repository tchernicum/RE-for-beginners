\begin{description}
	\item[byte] 8-bit.
		The DB assembly directive is used for defining variables and arrays of bytes.
		Bytes are passed in the 8-bit part of registers: \TT{AL/BL/CL/DL/AH/BH/CH/DH/SIL/DIL/R*L}.
	\item[word] 16-bit. 
		DW assembly directive \dittoclosing.
		Words are passed in the 16-bit part of the registers:\\
			\TT{AX/BX/CX/DX/SI/DI/R*W}.
	\item[double word] (\q{dword}) 32-bit.
		DD assembly directive \dittoclosing.
		Double words are passed in registers (x86) or in the 32-bit part of registers (x64). 
		In 16-bit code, double words are passed in 16-bit register pairs.
	\item[quad word] (\q{qword}) 64-bit.
		DQ assembly directive \dittoclosing.
		In 32-bit environment, quad words are passed in 32-bit register pairs.
	\item[tbyte] (10 bytes) 80-bit or 10 bytes (used for IEEE 754 FPU registers).
	\item[paragraph] (16 bytes)---term was popular in MS-DOS environment. % TODO link to a part about 8086 memory model...

Data types of the same width (BYTE, WORD, DWORD) are also the same in Windows \ac{API}.
