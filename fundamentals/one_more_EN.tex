\subsection{Couple of additions about two's complement form}

\epigraph{Exercise 2-1. Write a program to determine the ranges of \TT{char}, \TT{short}, \TT{int}, and \TT{long}
variables, both \TT{signed} and \TT{unsigned}, by printing appropriate values from standard headers
and by direct computation.}{\KRBook}

\subsubsection{Getting maximum number of some \gls{word}}

Maximum unsigned number is just a number where all bits are set: \emph{0xFF....FF}
(this is -1 if the \gls{word} is treated as signed integer).
So you take a \gls{word}, set all bits and get the value:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=customc]
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	unsigned int val=~0; // change to "unsigned char" to get maximal value for the unsigned 8-bit byte
	// 0-1 will also work, or just -1
	printf ("%u\n", val); // %u for unsigned
};
\end{lstlisting}

This is 4294967295 for 32-bit integer.

\subsubsection{Getting minimum number for some signed \gls{word}}

Minimum signed number is encoded as \emph{0x80....00}, i.e., most significant bit is set, while others are cleared.
Maximum signed number is encoded in the same way, but all bits are inverted: \emph{0x7F....FF}.

Let's shift a lone bit left until it disappears:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=customc]
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	signed int val=1; // change to "signed char" to find values for signed byte
	while (val!=0)
	{
		printf ("%d %d\n", val, ~val);
		val=val<<1;
	};
};
\end{lstlisting}

Output is:

\begin{lstlisting}
...

536870912 -536870913
1073741824 -1073741825
-2147483648 2147483647
\end{lstlisting}

Two last numbers are minimum and maximum signed 32-bit \emph{int} respectively.
