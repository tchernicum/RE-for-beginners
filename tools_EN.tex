\chapter{Tools}

\epigraph{Now that Dennis Yurichev has made this book free (libre), it is a
contribution to the world of free knowledge and free education.
However, for our freedom's sake, we need free (libre) reverse
engineering tools to replace the proprietary tools described in this book.}{Richard M. Stallman}

\mysection{Live analysis}

Tools you use on a live system or during running of a process.

\subsection{Debuggers}

\myindex{\olly}
\myindex{Radare}
\myindex{GDB}
\myindex{tracer}
\myindex{LLDB}
\myindex{WinDbg}
\myindex{IDA}

\begin{itemize}
\item (Free) \emph{OllyDbg}.
Very popular user-mode win32 debugger\footnote{\href{http://go.yurichev.com/17032}{ollydbg.de}}.
\ShortHotKeyCheatsheet: \myref{sec:Olly_cheatsheet}

\item (Free, open-source) \emph{GDB}.
Not quite popular debugger among reverse engineers, because it's intended mostly for programmers.
Some commands: \myref{sec:GDB_cheatsheet}.
There is a visual interface for GDB, ``GDB dashboard''\footnote{\url{https://github.com/cyrus-and/gdb-dashboard}}.

\item (Free, open-source) \emph{LLDB}\footnote{\url{http://lldb.llvm.org/}}.

\item \emph{WinDbg}\footnote{\url{https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/windows-driver-kit}}:
kernel debugger for Windows.

\item \emph{IDA} has internal debugger.

\item (Free, open-source) \emph{Radare} \ac{AKA} rada.re \ac{AKA} r2\footnote{\url{http://rada.re/r/}}.
A GUI also exists: \emph{ragui}\footnote{\url{http://radare.org/ragui/}}.

\item (Free, open-source) \emph{tracer}.
\label{tracer}
The author often uses \emph{tracer}
\footnote{\href{http://go.yurichev.com/17338}{yurichev.com}}
instead of a debugger.

The author of these lines stopped using a debugger eventually, since all he needs from it is to spot function arguments while
executing, or registers state at some point.
Loading a debugger each time is too much, so a small utility called \emph{tracer} was born.
It works from command line, allows intercepting function execution,
setting breakpoints at arbitrary places, reading and changing registers state, etc.

N.B.: the \emph{tracer} isn't evolving, because it was developed as a demonstration tool for this book, not as everyday tool.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Library calls tracing}

\emph{ltrace}\footnote{\url{http://www.ltrace.org/}}.

\subsection{System calls tracing}

\label{strace}
\myindex{strace}
\myindex{dtruss}
\subsubsection{strace / dtruss}

\myindex{syscall}
It shows which system calls (syscalls(\myref{syscalls})) are called by a process right now.

For example:

\begin{lstlisting}
# strace df -h

...

access("/etc/ld.so.nohwcap", F_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
read(3, "\177ELF\1\1\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\3\0\3\0\1\0\0\0\220\232\1\0004\0\0\0"..., 512) = 512
fstat64(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0755, st_size=1770984, ...}) = 0
mmap2(NULL, 1780508, PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_DENYWRITE, 3, 0) = 0xb75b3000
\end{lstlisting}

\myindex{\MacOSX}
\MacOSX has dtruss for doing the same.

\myindex{Cygwin}
Cygwin also has strace, but as far as it's known, it works only for .exe-files
compiled for the cygwin environment itself.

\subsection{Network sniffing}

\emph{Sniffing} is intercepting some information you may be interested in.

(Free, open-source) \emph{Wireshark}\footnote{\url{https://www.wireshark.org/}} for network sniffing.
It has also capability for USB sniffing\footnote{\url{https://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureSetup/USB}}.

Wireshark has a younger (or older) brother \emph{tcpdump}\footnote{\url{http://www.tcpdump.org/}}, simpler command-line tool.

\subsection{Sysinternals}

\myindex{Sysinternals}
(Free) Sysinternals (developed by Mark Russinovich)
\footnote{\url{https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb842062}}.
At least these tools are important and worth studying: Process Explorer, Handle, VMMap, TCPView, Process Monitor.

\subsection{Valgrind}

(Free, open-source) a powerful tool for detecting memory leaks: \url{http://valgrind.org/}.
Due to its powerful \ac{JIT} mechanism, Valgrind is used as a framework for other tools.

% TODO network fuzzing

\subsection{Emulators}

\begin{itemize}
\item (Free, open-source) \emph{QEMU}\footnote{\url{http://qemu.org}}: emulator for various CPUs and architectures.

\item (Free, open-source) \emph{DosBox}\footnote{\url{https://www.dosbox.com/}}: MS-DOS emulator, mostly used for retrogaming.

\item (Free, open-source) \emph{SimH}\footnote{\url{http://simh.trailing-edge.com/}}: emulator of ancient computers, mainframes, etc.
\end{itemize}

\mysection{Other tools}

\emph{Microsoft Visual Studio Express}
\footnote{\href{http://go.yurichev.com/17034}{visualstudio.com/en-US/products/visual-studio-express-vs}}:
Stripped-down free version of Visual Studio, convenient for simple experiments.

Some useful options: \myref{sec:MSVC_options}.

There is a website named ``Compiler Explorer'', allowing to compile small code snippets and see output
in various GCC versions and architectures
(at least x86, ARM, MIPS): \url{http://godbolt.org/}---I would have used it myself for the book if I would know about it!

\subsection{Calculators}

Good calculator for reverse engineer's needs should support at least decimal, hexadecimal and binary bases,
as well as many important operations like XOR and shifts.

\begin{itemize}

\item IDA has built-in calculator (``?'').

\item rada.re has \emph{rax2}.

\item \url{https://github.com/DennisYurichev/progcalc}

\item As a last resort, standard calculator in Windows has programmer's mode.

\end{itemize}
