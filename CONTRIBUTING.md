============

Proofreading
------------

Aside from LaTeX markup, there are only 2 macros you may be aware of.

"\RU{russian text}" and "\EN{english text}" used in places where the string of one specific language should be present.

Translating
-----------

Read [here](https://github.com/DennisYurichev/RE-for-beginners/blob/master/Translation.md).

Adding comments to source code
------------------------------

Commenting right in the LaTeX source code may be good idea.
LaTeX comments are started with percent ('%') sign.

It's fine to write comments like:
"I would love to read more about this and that right here at this place" and/or
"It's also a great idea to mention this and that right here".

[For example](https://github.com/DennisYurichev/RE-for-beginners/blob/b0fe5ef304fa3303c502c4f94ee147683a2ffb50/patterns/main.tex#L105).

When time will allow me, I will try to extend these parts.

Do not worry to bother me while writing me about any petty mistakes you found, even if you are not very confident.
I'm writing for beginners, after all, so beginners' opinions and comments are crucial for my job.
