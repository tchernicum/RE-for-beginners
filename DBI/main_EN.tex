\section{Why ``instrumentation''?}

Perhaps, this is a term of code profiling.
There are at least two methods:
1) "sampling": you break into running code as many times as possible (hundreds per second), and see, where it is executed at the moment;
2) "instrumentation": compiled code is interleaved with other code, which can increment counters, etc.

Perhaps, \ac{DBI} tools inherited the term?
