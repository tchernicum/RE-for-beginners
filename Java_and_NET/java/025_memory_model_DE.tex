\subsection{\ac{JVM}-Speichermodell}

%x86 and other low-level environments use the stack for argument passing and 
%as a local variables storage.
%
%\ac{JVM} is slightly different.
%
%It has:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Local variable array (\ac{LVA}).
%Used as storage for incoming function arguments and local variables.
%
%Instructions like \INS{iload\_0} load values from it.
%
%\INS{istore} stores values in it.
%At the beginning the function arguments are stored: starting at 0 or at 1 
%(if the zeroth argument is occupied by \emph{this} pointer).
%
%Then the local variables are allocated.
%
%
%Each slot has size of 32-bit.
%
%Hence, values of \emph{long} and \emph{double} data types occupy two slots.
%
%
%\item Operand stack (or just \q{stack}).
%It's used for computations and passing arguments while calling other functions.
%
%Unlike low-level environments like x86, it's not possible to access the stack without using
%instructions which explicitly pushes or pops values to/from it.
%
%
%\item Heap. It is used as storage for objects and arrays.
%
%\end{itemize}
%
%These 3 areas are isolated from each other.
