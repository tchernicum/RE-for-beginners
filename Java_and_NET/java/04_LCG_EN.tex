\subsection{Linear congruential \ac{PRNG}}

Let's try a simple pseudorandom numbers generator, 
which we already considered once in the book (\myref{LCG_simple}):


\begin{lstlisting}[style=customjava]
public class LCG 
{
	public static int rand_state;

	public void my_srand (int init)
	{
		rand_state=init;
	}

	public static int RNG_a=1664525;
	public static int RNG_c=1013904223;

	public int my_rand ()
	{
		rand_state=rand_state*RNG_a;
		rand_state=rand_state+RNG_c;
		return rand_state & 0x7fff;
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}

There are couple of class fields which are initialized at start.

But how?
In \TT{javap} output we can find the class constructor:


\begin{lstlisting}
  static {};
    flags: ACC_STATIC
    Code:
      stack=1, locals=0, args_size=0
         0: ldc           #5         // int 1664525
         2: putstatic     #3         // Field RNG_a:I
         5: ldc           #6         // int 1013904223
         7: putstatic     #4         // Field RNG_c:I
        10: return        
\end{lstlisting}

That's the way variables are initialized.

\TT{RNG\_a} occupies the 3rd slot in the class and \TT{RNG\_c}---4th, 
and \TT{putstatic} puts the constants there.


The \TT{my\_srand()} function just stores the input value in \TT{rand\_state}:


\begin{lstlisting}
  public void my_srand(int);
    flags: ACC_PUBLIC
    Code:
      stack=1, locals=2, args_size=2
         0: iload_1       
         1: putstatic     #2         // Field rand_state:I
         4: return        
\end{lstlisting}

\TT{iload\_1} takes the input value and pushes it into stack. But why not \TT{iload\_0}?

It's because this function may use fields of the class, and so \emph{this} is also passed to
the function as a zeroth argument.

The field \TT{rand\_state} occupies the 2nd slot in the class,
so \TT{putstatic} copies the value from the \ac{TOS} into the 2nd slot.


Now \TT{my\_rand()}:

\begin{lstlisting}
  public int my_rand();
    flags: ACC_PUBLIC
    Code:
      stack=2, locals=1, args_size=1
         0: getstatic     #2         // Field rand_state:I
         3: getstatic     #3         // Field RNG_a:I
         6: imul          
         7: putstatic     #2         // Field rand_state:I
        10: getstatic     #2         // Field rand_state:I
        13: getstatic     #4         // Field RNG_c:I
        16: iadd          
        17: putstatic     #2         // Field rand_state:I
        20: getstatic     #2         // Field rand_state:I
        23: sipush        32767
        26: iand          
        27: ireturn       
\end{lstlisting}

It just loads all the values from the object's fields, does the operations and updates 
\TT{rand\_state}'s value using the \TT{putstatic} instruction.

At offset 20, \TT{rand\_state} is reloaded again 
(because it has been dropped from the stack before, by \TT{putstatic}).

This looks like non-efficient code, but be sure, the \ac{JVM} is usually good enough to optimize
such things really well.
