For those who are not very good at playing Minesweeper, we could try to reveal the hidden mines in the debugger.

\myindex{\CStandardLibrary!rand()}
\myindex{Windows!PDB}

As we know, Minesweeper places mines randomly, so there has to be some kind of random number generator or
a call to the standard \TT{rand()} C-function.

What is really cool about reversing Microsoft products is that there are \gls{PDB} 
file with symbols (function names, etc).
When we load \TT{winmine.exe} into \IDA, it downloads the 
\gls{PDB} file exactly for this 
executable and shows all names.

So here it is, the only call to \TT{rand()} is this function:

\lstinputlisting[style=customasmx86]{examples/minesweeper/tmp1.lst}

\IDA named it so, and it was the name given to it by Minesweeper's developers.

The function is very simple:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=customc]
int Rnd(int limit)
{
    return rand() % limit;
};
\end{lstlisting}

(There is no \q{limit} name in the \gls{PDB} file; we manually named this argument like this.)

So it returns 
a random value from 0 to a specified limit.

\TT{Rnd()} is called only from one place, 
a function called \TT{StartGame()}, 
and as it seems, this is exactly 
the code which place the mines:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=customasmx86]
.text:010036C7                 push    _xBoxMac
.text:010036CD                 call    _Rnd@4          ; Rnd(x)
.text:010036D2                 push    _yBoxMac
.text:010036D8                 mov     esi, eax
.text:010036DA                 inc     esi
.text:010036DB                 call    _Rnd@4          ; Rnd(x)
.text:010036E0                 inc     eax
.text:010036E1                 mov     ecx, eax
.text:010036E3                 shl     ecx, 5          ; ECX=ECX*32
.text:010036E6                 test    _rgBlk[ecx+esi], 80h
.text:010036EE                 jnz     short loc_10036C7
.text:010036F0                 shl     eax, 5          ; EAX=EAX*32
.text:010036F3                 lea     eax, _rgBlk[eax+esi]
.text:010036FA                 or      byte ptr [eax], 80h
.text:010036FD                 dec     _cBombStart
.text:01003703                 jnz     short loc_10036C7
\end{lstlisting}

Minesweeper allows you to set the board size, so the X (xBoxMac) and Y (yBoxMac) of the board are global variables.
They are passed to \TT{Rnd()} and random 
coordinates are generated.
A mine is placed by the \TT{OR} instruction at \TT{0x010036FA}. 
And if it has been placed before 
(it's possible if the pair of \TT{Rnd()} 
generates a coordinates pair which has been already 
generated), 
then \TT{TEST} and \TT{JNZ} at \TT{0x010036E6} 
jumps to the generation routine again.

\TT{cBombStart} is the global variable containing total number of mines. So this is loop.

The width of the array is 32 
(we can conclude this by looking at the \TT{SHL} instruction, which multiplies one of the coordinates by 32).

The size of the \TT{rgBlk} 
global array can be easily determined by the difference 
between the \TT{rgBlk} 
label in the data segment and the next known one. 
It is 0x360 (864):

\begin{lstlisting}[style=customasmx86]
.data:01005340 _rgBlk          db 360h dup(?)          ; DATA XREF: MainWndProc(x,x,x,x)+574
.data:01005340                                         ; DisplayBlk(x,x)+23
.data:010056A0 _Preferences    dd ?                    ; DATA XREF: FixMenus()+2
...
\end{lstlisting}

$864/32=27$.

So the array size is $27*32$?
It is close to what we know: when we try to set board size to $100*100$ in Minesweeper settings, it fallbacks to a board of size $24*30$.
So this is the maximal board size here.
And the array has a fixed size for any board size.

So let's see all this in \olly.
We will ran Minesweeper, attaching \olly to it and now we can see the memory dump at the address of the \TT{rgBlk} array (\TT{0x01005340})
\footnote{All addresses here are for Minesweeper for Windows XP SP3 English. 
They may differ for other service packs.}.

So we got this memory dump of the array:

\lstinputlisting[style=customasmx86]{examples/minesweeper/1.lst}

\olly, like any other hexadecimal editor, shows 16 bytes per line.
So each 32-byte array row occupies exactly 2 lines here.

This is beginner level (9*9 board).

There is some square 
structure can be seen visually (0x10 bytes).

We will click \q{Run} in \olly to unfreeze the Minesweeper process, then we'll clicked randomly at the Minesweeper window 
and trapped into mine, but now all mines are visible:

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\myincludegraphicsSmall{examples/minesweeper/1.png}
\caption{Mines}
\label{fig:minesweeper1}
\end{figure}

By comparing the mine places and the dump, we can conclude that 0x10 stands for border, 0x0F---empty block, 0x8F---mine.
Perhaps, 0x10 is just a \emph{sentinel value}.

Now we'll add comments and also enclose all 0x8F bytes into square brackets:

\lstinputlisting[style=customasmx86]{examples/minesweeper/2.lst}

Now we'll remove all \emph{border bytes} (0x10) and what's beyond those:

\lstinputlisting[style=customasmx86]{examples/minesweeper/3.lst}

Yes, these are mines, now it can be clearly seen and compared with the screenshot.

\clearpage
What is interesting is that we can modify the array right in \olly.
We can remove all mines by changing all 0x8F bytes by 0x0F, and here is what we'll get in Minesweeper:

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\myincludegraphicsSmall{examples/minesweeper/3.png}
\caption{All mines are removed in debugger}
\label{fig:minesweeper3}
\end{figure}

We can also move all of them to the first line: 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\myincludegraphicsSmall{examples/minesweeper/2.png}
\caption{Mines set in debugger}
\label{fig:minesweeper2}
\end{figure}

Well, the debugger is not very convenient for eavesdropping (which is our goal anyway), so we'll write a small utility
to dump the contents of the board:

\lstinputlisting[style=customc]{examples/minesweeper/minesweeper_cheater.c}

Just set the \ac{PID}
\footnote{PID it can be seen in Task Manager 
(enable it in \q{View $\rightarrow$ Select Columns})} 
and the address of the array (\TT{0x01005340} for Windows XP SP3 English) 
and it will dump it
\footnote{The compiled executable is here: 
\href{http://go.yurichev.com/17165}{beginners.re}}.

It attaches itself to a win32 process by \ac{PID} and just reads process memory at the address.

\subsection{Finding grid automatically}

This is kind of nuisance to set address each time when we run our utility.
Also, various Minesweeper versions may have the array on different address.
Knowing the fact that there is always a border (0x10 bytes), we can just find it in memory:

\lstinputlisting[style=customc]{examples/minesweeper/cheater2_fragment.c}

\subsection{\Exercises}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
Why do the \emph{border bytes} (or \emph{sentinel values}) (0x10) exist in the array?

What they are for if they are not visible in Minesweeper's interface?
How could it work without them?

\item 
As it turns out, there are more values possible (for open blocks, for flagged by user, etc).
Try to find the meaning of each one.

\item 
Modify my utility so it can remove all mines or set them in a fixed pattern that you want in the Minesweeper
process currently running.

\end{itemize}
