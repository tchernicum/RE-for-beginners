\section*{Preface}

\subsection*{What is with two titles?}
\label{TwoTitles}

The book was named ``Reverse Engineering for Beginners'' in 2014-2018, but I always suspected this makes readership too narrow.

Infosec people know about ``reverse engineering'', but I've rarely hear the ``assembler'' word from them.

Likewise, the ``reverse engineering'' term is somewhat cryptic to a general audience of programmers, but they know about ``assembler''.

In July 2018, as an experiment, I've changed the title to ``Assembly Language for Beginners''
and posted the link to Hacker News website\footnote{\url{https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17549050}}, and the book was received generally well.

So let it be, the book now has two titles.

However, I've changed the second title to ``Understanding Assembly Language'', because someone already written ``Assembly Language for Beginners'' book.
Also, people say ``for Beginners'' sounds a bit sarcastic for the book of \textasciitilde{}1000 pages.

Two books differ only by title, filename (UAL-XX.pdf versus RE4B-XX.pdf), URL and couple of first pages.

\subsection*{About reverse engineering}

There are several popular meanings of the term \q{\gls{reverse engineering}}:

1) The reverse engineering of software; researching compiled programs

2) The scanning of 3D structures and the subsequent digital manipulation required in order to duplicate them

3) Recreating \ac{DBMS} structure

This book is about the first meaning.

\subsection*{Prerequisites}

Basic knowledge of the C \ac{PL}.

\subsection*{How to learn programming}

Many people keep asking about it.

There is no ``royal road'', but there are quite efficient ways.

From my own experience, this is just: solving exercises from:

\begin{itemize}
\item \KRBook
\item Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman, Julie Sussman -- Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
\item \TAOCP
\item Niklaus Wirth's books
\item \RobPikePractice
\end{itemize}

... in pure C and LISP.
You may never use these programming languages in future at all.
Almost all commercial programmers don’t. But C and LISP coding experience will help enormously in long run.

Also, you can skip reading books themselves,
just skim them whenever you feel you need to understand something you missing for the exercise you currently solving.

This may take years at best, or a lifetime, but still this is way faster than to rush between fads.

The success of these books probably related to the fact that their authors are teachers
and all this material has been honed on students first.

As of LISP, I personally would recommend Racket (Scheme dialect). But this is matter of taste, anyway.

Some people say assembly language understanding is also very helpful, even if you will never use it.
This is true.
But this is a way for the most dedicated geeks, and it can be postponed at start.

Also, self-taught people (including author of these lines) often has the problem of trying too hard on hard problems,
skipping easy ones.
This is a great mistake.
Compare to sport or music -- no one starts at 100kg weights, or Paganini's Caprices.
I would say -- you can try to tackle a problem if you can outline its solution in your mind.

Good luck!

\subsection*{About the Korean translation}

In January 2015, the Acorn publishing company (\href{http://www.acornpub.co.kr}{www.acornpub.co.kr}) in South Korea did a huge amount of work in translating and publishing
this book (as it was in August 2014) into Korean.

It's available now at \href{http://go.yurichev.com/17343}{their website}.

The translator is Byungho Min (\href{http://go.yurichev.com/17344}{twitter/tais9}).
The cover art was done by the artistic Andy Nechaevsky, a friend of the author:
\href{http://go.yurichev.com/17023}{facebook/andydinka}.
Acorn also holds the copyright to the Korean translation.

So, if you want to have a \emph{real} book on your shelf in Korean and
want to support this work, it is now available for purchase.

\subsection*{About the Persian/Farsi translation}

In 2016 the book was translated by Mohsen Mostafa Jokar (who is also known to Iranian community for his translation of Radare manual\footnote{\url{http://rada.re/get/radare2book-persian.pdf}}).
It is available on the publisher’s website\footnote{\url{http://goo.gl/2Tzx0H}} (Pendare Pars).

Here is a link to a 40-page excerpt: \url{https://beginners.re/farsi.pdf}.

\subsection*{About the Chinese translation}

In April 2017, translation to Chinese was completed by Chinese PTPress. They are also the Chinese translation copyright holders.

 The Chinese version is available for order here: \url{http://www.epubit.com.cn/book/details/4174}. A partial review and history behind the translation can be found here: \url{http://www.cptoday.cn/news/detail/3155}.

The principal translator is Archer, to whom the author owes very much. He was extremely meticulous (in a good sense) and reported most of the known mistakes and bugs, which is very important in literature such as this book.
The author would recommend his services to any other author!

The guys from \href{http://www.antiy.net/}{Antiy Labs} has also helped with translation. \href{http://www.epubit.com.cn/book/onlinechapter/51413}{Here is preface} written by them.
