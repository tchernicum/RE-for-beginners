\chapter{Finding important/interesting stuff in the code}

Minimalism it is not a prominent feature of modern software.

\myindex{\Cpp!STL}

But not because the programmers are writing a lot, but because a lot of libraries are commonly linked statically
to executable files.
If all external libraries were shifted into an external DLL files, the world would be different.
(Another reason for C++ are the \ac{STL} and other template libraries.)

\newcommand{\FOOTNOTEBOOST}{\footnote{\url{http://go.yurichev.com/17036}}}
\newcommand{\FOOTNOTELIBPNG}{\footnote{\url{http://go.yurichev.com/17037}}}

Thus, it is very important to determine the origin of a function, if it is from standard library or 
well-known library (like Boost\FOOTNOTEBOOST, libpng\FOOTNOTELIBPNG),
or if it is related to what we are trying to find in the code.

It is just absurd to rewrite all code in \CCpp to find what we're looking for.

One of the primary tasks of a reverse engineer is to find quickly the code he/she needs.

\myindex{\GrepUsage}

The \IDA disassembler allow us to search among text strings, byte sequences and constants.
It is even possible to export the code to .lst or .asm text files and then use \TT{grep}, \TT{awk}, etc.

When you try to understand what some code is doing, this easily could be some open-source library like libpng.
So when you see some constants or text strings which look familiar, it is always worth to \emph{google} them.
And if you find the opensource project where they are used, 
then it's enough just to compare the functions.
It may solve some part of the problem.

For example, if a program uses XML files, the first step may be determining which
XML library is used for processing, since the standard (or well-known) libraries are usually used
instead of self-made one.

\myindex{SAP}
\myindex{Windows!PDB}

For example, the author of these lines once tried to understand how the compression/decompression of network packets works in SAP 6.0. 
It is a huge software, but a detailed .\gls{PDB} with debugging information is present, 
and that is convenient.
He finally came to the idea that one of the functions, that was called \emph{CsDecomprLZC}, was doing the decompression of network packets.
Immediately he tried to google its name and he quickly found the function was used in MaxDB
(it is an open-source SAP project) \footnote{More about it in relevant section~(\myref{sec:SAPGUI})}.

\url{http://www.google.com/search?q=CsDecomprLZC}

Astoundingly, MaxDB and SAP 6.0 software shared likewise code for the compression/decompression of network packets.

\mysection{Communication with outer world (function level)}
It's often advisable to track function arguments and return values in debugger or \ac{DBI}.
For example, the author once tried to understand meaning of some obscure function, which happens to be incorrectly
implemented bubble sort\footnote{\url{https://yurichev.com/blog/weird_sort/}}.
(It worked correctly, but slower.)
Meanwhile, watching inputs and outputs of this function helps instantly to understand what it does.

Often, when you see division by multiplication (\myref{sec:divisionbymult}),
but forgot all details about its mechanics, you can just observe input
and output and quickly find divisor.

\mysection{Other things}

\subsection{General idea}

A reverse engineer should try to be in programmer's shoes as often as possible. 
To take his/her viewpoint and ask himself, how would one solve some task the specific case.

\subsection{Order of functions in binary code}

All functions located in a single .c or .cpp-file are compiled into corresponding object (.o) file.
Later, linker puts all object files it needs together, not changing order or functions in them.
As a consequence, if you see two or more consecutive functions, it means, that they were placed together
in a single source code file (unless you're on border of two object files, of course.)
This means these functions have something in common, that they are from the same \ac{API} level, from same library, etc.

\subsection{Tiny functions}

Tiny functions like empty functions (\myref{empty_func})
or function which returns just ``true'' (1) or ``false'' (0) (\myref{ret_val_func}) are very common,
and almost all decent compilers tend to put only one such function into resulting executable code even if there were several
similar functions in source code.
So, whenever you see a tiny function consisting just of \TT{mov eax, 1 / ret}
which is referenced (and can be called) from many places,
which are seems unconnected to each other, this may be a result of such optimization.%

\subsection{\Cpp}

\ac{RTTI}~(\myref{RTTI})-data may be also useful for \Cpp class identification.
