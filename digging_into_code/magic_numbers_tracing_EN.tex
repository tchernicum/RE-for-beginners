\mysection{Using magic numbers while tracing}

Often, our main goal is to understand how the program uses a value that has been either read from file or received via network. 
The manual tracing of a value is often a very labor-intensive task. One of the simplest techniques for this (although not 100\% reliable) 
is to use your own \emph{magic number}.

This resembles X-ray computed tomography is some sense: a radiocontrast agent is injected into the patient's blood,
which is then used to improve the visibility of the patient's internal structure in to the X-rays.
It is well known how the blood of healthy humans
percolates in the kidneys and if the agent is in the blood, it can be easily seen on tomography, how blood is percolating,
and are there any stones or tumors.

We can take a 32-bit number like \TT{0x0badf00d}, or someone's birth date like \TT{0x11101979}
and write this 4-byte number to some point in a file used by the program we investigate.

Then, while tracing this program with \tracer in \emph{code coverage} mode, with the help of \emph{grep}
or just by searching in the text file (of tracing results), we can easily see where the value has been used and how.

Example 
of \emph{grepable} \tracer results in \emph{cc} mode:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=customasmx86]
0x150bf66 (_kziaia+0x14), e=       1 [MOV EBX, [EBP+8]] [EBP+8]=0xf59c934 
0x150bf69 (_kziaia+0x17), e=       1 [MOV EDX, [69AEB08h]] [69AEB08h]=0 
0x150bf6f (_kziaia+0x1d), e=       1 [FS: MOV EAX, [2Ch]] 
0x150bf75 (_kziaia+0x23), e=       1 [MOV ECX, [EAX+EDX*4]] [EAX+EDX*4]=0xf1ac360 
0x150bf78 (_kziaia+0x26), e=       1 [MOV [EBP-4], ECX] ECX=0xf1ac360 
\end{lstlisting}
% TODO: good example!

This can be used for network packets as well.
It is important for the \emph{magic number} to be unique and not to be present in the program's code.

\myindex{MS-DOS}
Aside of 
the \tracer, DosBox (MS-DOS emulator) in heavydebug mode
is able to write information about all registers' states for each executed instruction of the program to a plain text file\footnote{See also my 
blog post about this DosBox feature: \DOSBOXURL{}}, so this technique may be useful for DOS programs as well.
