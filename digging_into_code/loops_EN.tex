\mysection{Loops}

Whenever your program works with some kind of file, or buffer of some size,
it has to be some kind of decrypting/processing loop inside of the code.

This is a real example of \tracer tool output.
There was a code which loads some kind of encryted file of 258 bytes.
I run it with the intention to get each instruction counts (a \ac{DBI} tool will serve much better these days).
And I quickly found a piece of code, which executed 259/258 times:

\lstinputlisting{digging_into_code/crypto_loop.txt}

As it turns out, this is the decrypting loop.
