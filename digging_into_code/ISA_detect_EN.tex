\mysection{\ac{ISA} detection}
\label{ISA_detect}

Often, you can deal with a binary file for an unknown \ac{ISA}.
Perhaps, easiest way to detect \ac{ISA} is to try various ones in IDA, objdump or another disassembler.

To achieve this, one should understand a difference between incorrectly disassembled code and correctly one.

\subsection{Correctly disassembled code}
\label{correctly_disasmed_code}

Each \ac{ISA} has a dozen of a most used instructions, all the rest are used much less often.

As of x86, it is interesting to know that the fact that function calls (\PUSH/\CALL/\ADD) and \MOV
instructions are the most frequently executed pieces of code in almost all
programs we use.
In other words, \ac{CPU} is very busy passing information between levels of abstractions, or,
it can be said, it's very busy switching between these levels.
Regardless type of \ac{ISA}.
This is a cost of splitting problems into several levels of abstractions (so humans could work with them easier).
