\subsection{Finding strings in binary}

\epigraph{Actually, the best form of Unix documentation is frequently running the
\textbf{strings} command over a program’s object code. Using \textbf{strings}, you can get
a complete list of the program’s hard-coded file name, environment variables,
undocumented options, obscure error messages, and so forth.}{The Unix-Haters Handbook}

\myindex{UNIX!strings}
The standard UNIX \emph{strings} utility is quick-n-dirty way to see strings in file.
For example, these are some strings from OpenSSH 7.2 sshd executable file:

\lstinputlisting{digging_into_code/sshd_strings.txt}

There are options, error messages, file paths, imported dynamic modules and functions, some other strange strings (keys?)
There is also unreadable noise---x86 code sometimes has chunks consisting of printable ASCII characters, up to ~8 characters.

Of course, OpenSSH is open-source program.
But looking at readable strings inside of some unknown binary is often a first step of analysis.
\myindex{UNIX!grep}

\emph{grep} can be applied as well.

\myindex{Hiew}
\myindex{Sysinternals}
Hiew has the same capability (Alt-F6), as well as Sysinternals ProcessMonitor.

\subsection{Error/debug messages}

Debugging messages are very helpful if present.
In some sense, the debugging messages are reporting
what's going on in the program right now. Often these are \printf-like functions,
which write to log-files, or sometimes do not writing anything but the calls are still present 
since the build is not a debug one but \emph{release} one.
\myindex{\oracle}

If local or global variables are dumped in debug messages, it might be helpful as well 
since it is possible to get at least the variable names.
For example, one of such function in \oracle is \TT{ksdwrt()}.

Meaningful text strings are often helpful.
The \IDA disassembler may show from which function and from which point this specific string is used.
Funny cases sometimes happen\footnote{\href{http://go.yurichev.com/17223}{blog.yurichev.com}}.

The error messages may help us as well.
In \oracle, errors are reported using a group of functions.\\
You can read more about them here: \href{http://go.yurichev.com/17224}{blog.yurichev.com}.

\myindex{Error messages}

It is possible to find quickly which functions report errors and in which conditions.

By the way, this is often the reason for copy-protection systems to inarticulate cryptic error messages 
or just error numbers. No one is happy when the software cracker quickly understand why the copy-protection
is triggered just by the error message.

One example of encrypted error messages is here: \myref{examples_SCO}.

\subsection{Suspicious magic strings}

Some magic strings which are usually used in backdoors look pretty suspicious.

For example, there was a backdoor in the TP-Link WR740 home router\footnote{\url{http://sekurak.pl/tp-link-httptftp-backdoor/}}.
The backdoor can activated using the following URL:\\
\url{http://192.168.0.1/userRpmNatDebugRpm26525557/start_art.html}.\\

Indeed, the \q{userRpmNatDebugRpm26525557} string is present in the firmware.

This string was not googleable until the wide disclosure of information about the backdoor.

You would not find this in any \ac{RFC}.

You would not find any computer science algorithm which uses such strange byte sequences.

And it doesn't look like an error or debugging message.

So it's a good idea to inspect the usage of such weird strings.\\
\\
\myindex{base64}

Sometimes, such strings are encoded using base64.

So it's a good idea to decode them all and to scan them visually, even a glance should be enough.\\
\\
\myindex{Security through obscurity}
More precise, this method of hiding backdoors is called \q{security through obscurity}.
