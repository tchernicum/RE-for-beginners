\subsection{x86}

\subsubsection{MSVC}

Here is what we get after compilation (MSVC 2010 Express):

\lstinputlisting[label=src:passing_arguments_ex_MSVC_cdecl,caption=MSVC 2010 Express,style=customasmx86]{patterns/05_passing_arguments/msvc_EN.asm}

\myindex{x86!\Registers!EBP}

What we see is that the \main function pushes 3 numbers onto the stack and calls \TT{f(int,int,int).} 

Argument access inside \ttf is organized with the help of macros like:\\
\TT{\_a\$ = 8}, 
in the same way as local variables, but with positive offsets (addressed with \emph{plus}).
So, we are addressing the \emph{outer} side of the \gls{stack frame} by adding the \TT{\_a\$} macro to the value in the \EBP register.

\myindex{x86!\Instructions!IMUL}
\myindex{x86!\Instructions!ADD}

Then the value of $a$ is stored into \EAX. After \IMUL instruction execution, the value in \EAX is 
a \gls{product} of the value in \EAX and the content of \TT{\_b}.

After that, \ADD adds the value in \TT{\_c} to \EAX.

The value in \EAX does not need to be moved: it is already where it must be.
On returning to \gls{caller}, it takes the \EAX value and uses it as an argument to \printf.

\subsubsection{GCC}

Let's compile the same in GCC 4.4.1 and see the results in \IDA:

\lstinputlisting[caption=GCC 4.4.1,style=customasmx86]{patterns/05_passing_arguments/gcc_EN.asm}

The result is almost the same with some minor differences discussed earlier.

The \gls{stack pointer} is not set back after the two function calls(f and printf), 
because the penultimate \TT{LEAVE} (\myref{x86_ins:LEAVE}) 
instruction takes care of this at the end.
