\subsubsection{Passing function arguments}

The most popular way to pass parameters in x86 is called \q{cdecl}:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=customasmx86]
push arg3
push arg2
push arg1
call f
add esp, 12 ; 4*3=12
\end{lstlisting}

\Gls{callee} functions get their arguments via the stack pointer.

Therefore, this is how the argument values are located in the stack before the execution of the \ttf{} function's very first instruction:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | l | l | }
\hline
ESP & return address \\
\hline
ESP+4 & \argument \#1, \MarkedInIDAAs{} \TT{arg\_0} \\
\hline
ESP+8 & \argument \#2, \MarkedInIDAAs{} \TT{arg\_4} \\
\hline
ESP+0xC & \argument \#3, \MarkedInIDAAs{} \TT{arg\_8} \\
\hline
\dots & \dots \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

For more information on other calling conventions see also section~(\myref{sec:callingconventions}).

\par
By the way, the \gls{callee} function does not have any information about how many arguments were passed.
C functions with a variable number of arguments (like \printf) determine their number using format string specifiers (which begin with the \% symbol).

If we write something like:

\begin{lstlisting}
printf("%d %d %d", 1234);
\end{lstlisting}

\printf will print 1234, and then two random numbers\footnote{Not random in strict sense, but rather unpredictable: \myref{noise_in_stack}}, which were lying next to it in the stack.

\par
That's why it is not very important how we declare the \main function: as \main, \\
\TT{main(int argc, char *argv[])} or \TT{main(int argc, char *argv[], char *envp[])}.

In fact, the \ac{CRT}-code is calling \main roughly as:
	
\begin{lstlisting}[style=customasmx86]
push envp
push argv
push argc
call main
...
\end{lstlisting}

If you declare \main as \main without arguments, they are, nevertheless, still present in the stack, but are not used.
If you declare \main as  \TT{main(int argc, char *argv[])},
you will be able to use first two arguments, and the third will remain \q{invisible} for your function.
Even more, it is possible to declare \TT{main(int argc)}, and it will work.

\myparagraph{Alternative ways of passing arguments}

It is worth noting that nothing obliges programmers to pass arguments through the stack. It is not a requirement.
One could implement any other method without using the stack at all.

A somewhat popular way among assembly language newbies is to pass arguments via global variables, like:

\lstinputlisting[caption=Assembly code,style=customasmx86]{patterns/02_stack/global_args.asm}

But this method has obvious drawback: \emph{do\_something()} function cannot call itself recursively (or via another function),
because it has to zap its own arguments.
The same story with local variables: if you hold them in global variables, the function couldn't call itself.
And this is also not thread-safe
\footnote{Correctly implemented, each thread would have its own stack with its own arguments/variables.}.
A method to store such information in stack makes this easier---it can hold as many function arguments and/or values,
as much space it has.

\InSqBrackets{\TAOCPvolI{}, 189} mentions even weirder schemes particularly convenient on IBM System/360.

\myindex{MS-DOS}
\myindex{x86!\Instructions!INT}

MS-DOS had a way of passing all function arguments via registers, for example, this is piece of
code for ancient 16-bit MS-DOS prints ``Hello, world!'':

\begin{lstlisting}[style=customasmx86]
mov  dx, msg      ; address of message
mov  ah, 9        ; 9 means "print string" function
int  21h          ; DOS "syscall"

mov  ah, 4ch      ; "terminate program" function
int  21h          ; DOS "syscall"

msg  db 'Hello, World!\$'
\end{lstlisting}

\myindex{fastcall}
This is quite similar to \myref{fastcall} method.
And also it's very similar to calling syscalls in Linux (\myref{linux_syscall}) and Windows.

\myindex{x86!\Flags!CF}
If a MS-DOS function is going to return a boolean value (i.e., single bit, usually indicating error state),
\TT{CF} flag was often used.

For example:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=customasmx86]
mov ah, 3ch       ; create file
lea dx, filename
mov cl, 1
int 21h
jc  error
mov file_handle, ax
...
error:
...
\end{lstlisting}

In case of error, \TT{CF} flag is raised. Otherwise, handle of newly created file is returned via \TT{AX}.

This method is still used by assembly language programmers.
In Windows Research Kernel source code (which is quite similar to Windows 2003) we can find something like this
(file \emph{base/ntos/ke/i386/cpu.asm}):

\begin{lstlisting}[style=customasmx86]
        public  Get386Stepping
Get386Stepping  proc

        call    MultiplyTest            ; Perform multiplication test
        jnc     short G3s00             ; if nc, muttest is ok
        mov     ax, 0
        ret
G3s00:
        call    Check386B0              ; Check for B0 stepping
        jnc     short G3s05             ; if nc, it's B1/later
        mov     ax, 100h                ; It is B0/earlier stepping
        ret

G3s05:
        call    Check386D1              ; Check for D1 stepping
        jc      short G3s10             ; if c, it is NOT D1
        mov     ax, 301h                ; It is D1/later stepping
        ret

G3s10:
        mov     ax, 101h                ; assume it is B1 stepping
        ret

	...

MultiplyTest    proc

        xor     cx,cx                   ; 64K times is a nice round number
mlt00:  push    cx
        call    Multiply                ; does this chip's multiply work?
        pop     cx
        jc      short mltx              ; if c, No, exit
        loop    mlt00                   ; if nc, YEs, loop to try again
        clc
mltx:
        ret

MultiplyTest    endp
\end{lstlisting}
