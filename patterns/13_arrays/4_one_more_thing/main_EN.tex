\subsection{One more word about arrays}


Now we understand why it is impossible to write something like this in \CCpp code:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=customc]
void f(int size)
{
    int a[size];
...
};
\end{lstlisting}


That's just because the compiler must know the exact array size to allocate space for 
it in the local stack layout on at the compiling stage.

\myindex{\CLanguageElements!C99!variable length arrays}
\myindex{\CStandardLibrary!alloca()}

If you need an array of arbitrary size, allocate it by using \TT{malloc()}, then access the allocated memory block
as an array of variables of the type you need.


Or use the C99 standard feature \InSqBrackets{\CNineNineStd 6.7.5/2},
and it works like \emph{alloca()}~(\myref{alloca}) internally.


It's also possible to use garbage collecting libraries for C.

And there are also libraries supporting smart pointers for C++.
