\subsection{\Conclusion{}}

An array is a pack of values in memory located adjacently.

It's true for any element type, including structures.

Access to a specific array element is just a calculation of its address.

\myindex{Hex-Rays}
So, a pointer to an array and address of a first element---is the same thing.
This is why \TT{ptr[0]} and \TT{*ptr} expressions are equivalent in \CCpp.
It's interesting to note that Hex-Rays often replaces the first by the second.
It does so when it have no idea that it works with pointer to the whole array,
and thinks that this is a pointer to single variable.
