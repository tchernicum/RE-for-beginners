\subsection{Number sign (\#) before number}

The Keil compiler, \IDA and objdump precede all numbers with the \q{\#} number sign, for example:
\lstref{Keil_number_sign}.

But when GCC 4.9 generates assembly language output, it doesn't, for example: 
\lstref{GCC_no_number_sign}.

The ARM listings in this book are somewhat mixed.

It's hard to say, which method is right.
Supposedly, one has to obey the rules accepted in environment he/she works in.
