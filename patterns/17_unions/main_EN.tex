\mysection{Unions}

\CCpp \emph{union} is mostly used for interpreting a variable (or memory block) of one data type as a variable of another data type.

\subsection{Fast square root calculation}

Another well-known algorithm where \Tfloat is interpreted as integer is fast calculation of square root.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=The source code is taken from Wikipedia: \url{http://go.yurichev.com/17364},style=customc]
/* Assumes that float is in the IEEE 754 single precision floating point format
 * and that int is 32 bits. */
float sqrt_approx(float z)
{
    int val_int = *(int*)&z; /* Same bits, but as an int */
    /*
     * To justify the following code, prove that
     *
     * ((((val_int / 2^m) - b) / 2) + b) * 2^m = ((val_int - 2^m) / 2) + ((b + 1) / 2) * 2^m)
     *
     * where
     *
     * b = exponent bias
     * m = number of mantissa bits
     *
     * .
     */
 
    val_int -= 1 << 23; /* Subtract 2^m. */
    val_int >>= 1; /* Divide by 2. */
    val_int += 1 << 29; /* Add ((b + 1) / 2) * 2^m. */
 
    return *(float*)&val_int; /* Interpret again as float */
}
\end{lstlisting}

As an exercise, you can try to compile this function and to understand, how it works. \\

There is also well-known algorithm of fast calculation of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}$.
\myindex{Quake III Arena}
Algorithm became popular, supposedly, because it was used in Quake III Arena.
