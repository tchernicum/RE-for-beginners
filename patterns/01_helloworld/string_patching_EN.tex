\subsubsection{String patching (Win32)}

We can easily find the ``hello, world'' string in the executable file using Hiew:

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\myincludegraphics{patterns/01_helloworld/hola_edit1.png}
\caption{Hiew}
\label{}
\end{figure}

And we can try to translate our message into Spanish:

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\myincludegraphics{patterns/01_helloworld/hola_edit2.png}
\caption{Hiew}
\label{}
\end{figure}

The Spanish text is one byte shorter than English, so we also added the 0x0A byte at the end (\TT{\textbackslash{}n}) with a zero byte.

It works.

What if we want to insert a longer message?
There are some zero bytes after original English text.
It's hard to say if they can be overwritten: they may be used somewhere in \ac{CRT} code, or maybe not.
Anyway, only overwrite them if you really know what you're doing.

\subsubsection{String patching (Linux x64)}

\myindex{\radare}
Let's try to patch a Linux x64 executable using \radare{}:

\lstinputlisting[caption=\radare{} session]{patterns/01_helloworld/radare.lst}

Here's what's going on: I searched for the \q{hello} string using the \TT{/} command,
then I set the \emph{cursor} (\emph{seek}, in \radare{} terms) to that address.
Then I want to be sure that this is really that place: \TT{px} dumps bytes there.
\TT{oo+} switches \radare{} to \emph{read-write} mode.
\TT{w} writes an ASCII string at the current \emph{seek}.
Note the \TT{\textbackslash{}00} at the end---this is a zero byte.
\TT{q} quits.

\subsubsection{Software \emph{localization} of MS-DOS era}

This method was a common way to translate MS-DOS software to Russian language back to 1980's and 1990's.
Russian words and sentences are usually slightly longer than its English counterparts, so that is why \emph{localized}
software has a lot of weird acronyms and hardly readable abbreviations.

Perhaps this also happened to other languages during that era, in other countries.
