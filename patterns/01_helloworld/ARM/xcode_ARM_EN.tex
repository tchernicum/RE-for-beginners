\subsubsection{\OptimizingXcodeIV (\ARMMode)}

Xcode 4.6.3 without optimization turned on produces a lot of redundant code so we'll study optimized output, where the instruction count is as small as possible, setting the compiler switch \Othree.

The instructions \TT{STMFD} and \TT{LDMFD} are already familiar to us.

\myindex{ARM!\Instructions!MOV}

The \MOV instruction just writes the number \TT{0x1686} into the \Reg{0} register.
This is the offset pointing to the \q{Hello world!} string.

The \TT{R7} register (as it is standardized in \IOSABI) is a frame pointer. More on that below.

\myindex{ARM!\Instructions!MOVT}
The \TT{MOVT R0, \#0} (MOVe Top) instruction writes 0 into higher 16 bits of the register.
The issue here is that the generic \MOV instruction in ARM mode may write only the lower 16 bits of the register.

Keep in mind, all instruction opcodes in ARM mode are limited in size to 32 bits. Of course, this limitation is not related to moving data between registers.
That's why an additional instruction \TT{MOVT} exists for writing into the higher bits (from 16 to 31 inclusive).
Its usage here, however, is redundant because the \TT{MOV R0, \#0x1686} instruction above cleared the higher part of the register.
This is supposedly a shortcoming of the compiler.
% TODO:
% I think, more specifically, the string is not put in the text section,
% ie. the compiler is actually not using position-independent code,
% as mentioned in the next paragraph.
% MOVT is used because the assembly code is generated before the relocation,
% so the location of the string is not yet known,
% and the high bits may still be needed.

\myindex{ARM!\Instructions!ADD}
The \TT{ADD R0, PC, R0} instruction adds the value in the \ac{PC} to the value in the \Reg{0}, to calculate the absolute address of the \q{Hello world!} string. 
As we already know, it is \q{\PICcode} so this correction is essential here.

The \INS{BL} instruction calls the \puts function instead of \printf.

\label{puts}
\myindex{\CStandardLibrary!puts()}
\myindex{puts() instead of printf()}

GCC replaced the first \printf call with \puts.
Indeed: \printf with a sole argument is almost analogous to \puts. 

\emph{Almost}, because the two functions are producing the same result only in case the 
string does not contain printf format identifiers starting with \emph{\%}. 
In case it does, the effect of these two functions would be different
\footnote{It has also to be noted the \puts does not require a `\textbackslash{}n' new line symbol 
at the end of a string, so we do not see it here.}.

Why did the compiler replace the \printf with \puts? Presumably because \puts is faster
\footnote{\href{http://go.yurichev.com/17063}{ciselant.de/projects/gcc\_printf/gcc\_printf.html}}. 

Because it just passes characters to \gls{stdout} without comparing every one of them with the \emph{\%} symbol.

Next, we see the familiar \TT{MOV R0, \#0} instruction intended to set the \Reg{0} register to 0.
