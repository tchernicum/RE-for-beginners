Let's use the famous example from the book [\KRBook]:

\subsection{x86-64}
\input{patterns/01_helloworld/MSVC_x64}
\input{patterns/01_helloworld/GCC_x64}

\input{patterns/01_helloworld/MIPS/main}

\subsection{\Conclusion{}}

The main difference between x86/ARM and x64/ARM64 code is that the pointer to the string is now 64-bits in length.
Indeed, modern \ac{CPU}s are now 64-bit due to both the reduced cost of memory and the greater demand for it by modern applications. 
We can add much more memory to our computers than 32-bit pointers are able to address.
As such, all pointers are now 64-bit.
