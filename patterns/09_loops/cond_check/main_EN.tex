\subsection{Condition check}

It's important to keep in mind that in \emph{for()} construct, condition is checked not at the end, but at the beginning, before execution of loop body.
But often, it's more convenient for compiler to check it at the end, after body.
Sometimes, additional check can be appended at the beginning.

For example:

\lstinputlisting[style=customc]{patterns/09_loops/cond_check/1.c}

Optimizing GCC 5.4.0 x64:

\lstinputlisting[style=customasmx86]{patterns/09_loops/cond_check/1.s}

We see two checks.

\myindex{Hex-Rays}
Hex-Rays (at least version 2.2.0) decompiles this as:

\lstinputlisting[style=customc]{patterns/09_loops/cond_check/hexrays.c}

In this case, \emph{do/while()} can be replaced by \emph{for()} without any doubt, and the first check can be removed.
