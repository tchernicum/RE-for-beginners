   Jan-2019: There was a time when \IT macro was used for italic text and \ITA for Italian text.
             To be consistent, I'm using \emph for italic text now and \IT for Italian text.
             True for filename suffixes as well.

             Also, \JA macro is now used for Japanese, instead of \JPN.
